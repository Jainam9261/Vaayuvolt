              <p>
                My journey into wind energy began during my Mechanical Engineering studies, where I worked on a
                Vertical Axis Wind Turbine project that revealed both the potential and the challenges of wind
                power in Indian conditions. I realized that for renewable energy to truly succeed, it must be
                engineered with practicality, reliability, and local realities in mind.
              </p>
              <p>
                With hands-on experience in mechanical design and manufacturing, I founded Vaayuvolt to bridge
                the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world energy needs. Our goal is to build wind
                systems that are not only efficient, but durable, serviceable, and suited for long-term operation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Santal Energy represents my commitment to indigenous engineering, clean technology, and
                contributing meaningfully to India’s renewable energy future.
